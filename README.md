# Resume-Projects

This repository contains a collection of personal programming projects written in C and Racket.

Projects

Manual Memory Management
A custom memory allocator in C that manages dynamic memory for mixed data types within a single malloc’d space. Implements allocation, reuse, and management of memory blocks using void pointers and pointer arithmetic.

N-Queens Solver
A solver for the N-Queens problem written in Racket. The program outputs all valid solutions for an N×N board and uses optimized row-wise search to significantly reduce computation time for large N.

Tideman Voting System
A ranked-choice voting system implemented in C. Uses recursive cycle detection to determine the winner, with a custom merge sort to manage paired winner-loser relationships.

Quest++ — University Enrollment System
A modular enrollment system written in C. Features include course registration, student record management, and validation of enrollment constraints, built with interacting modules and a text-based interface.

Prime List Generator
A prime number generator implemented in Racket using a functional version of the Sieve of Eratosthenes. Refactored for performance to efficiently handle large N values.
